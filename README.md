# TaskingBuddy

### Project Description:
Tasking Buddy is an application designed to improve productivity and make work sessions less tiresome. An animated sprite will work and take breaks alongside you while the customizable pomodoro timer runs.

### Current Progress (3/20/2023):
The program is currently a functional Pomodoro timer which runs for 25 mintues of work time followed by 5 minutes of break time. The timer has a pause and resume functionality as well as a function to reset the entire timer. A gif can be added to the program under the name work_gif.gif in the Assets folder, but the program currently has no functionality for the movement completed yet.
